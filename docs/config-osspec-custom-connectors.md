# Custom Connections
You may encounter network devices that require additional steps beyond the
standard login process.  For example, the Cisco WLC Aireos v8.5 requires the
Username and Password values to be provided, even after the SSH connection was
established using the same credentials.

In such cases the goal of `netcfgbu` is to provide the necessary SSH connector,
but in such a way that it is not specifically tied to a network vendor or OS. 
For example there may be other network devices that behave the same way as the
WLC, and you could use the same connector for the WLC and this other device
type.

To use a custom connector type you can add the `connection` value in
the OS section of your [configuration file](configuration-file.md).  

Example for Cisco WLC:
```toml
[os_name.aireos]
    show_running = "show run-config commands"
    disable_paging = "config paging disable"
    connection = "netcfgbu.connectors.ssh.LoginPromptUserPass"
```

The `connection` value identifies the python module location where this
connector can be found. In the above example, you can find
[LoginPromptUserPass here](../netcfgbu/connectors/ssh.py). This approach
allows you to use a connector that is either packaged with `netcfgbu` or use
one that can be found in another python package should that be necessary.

If you have a need for a custom connector and would like it written for you,
please [open an issue](https://github.com/jeremyschulman/netcfgbu/issues).
